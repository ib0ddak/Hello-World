# Hello-World

                                                     The truth about the acorn can be found in the tree.

    Hi, I go by the name b0ddak.  I am currently a student studying Cyber Security and Digital Forensics.  It is my dream to one day work for Red Hat and then become a Freelance Ethical Hacker to assist in the fight in keeping the Governments prying eyes from spying on everything we do.  Our privacy is a Constitutional right and it's time to take it back...Like it or not, we are all part of this silent war.
